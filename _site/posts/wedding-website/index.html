<h3>Why 11ty?</h3>
<p>Eleventy stands out as a simple yet powerful static site generator, offering the ability to create fast, lightweight websites effortlessly. Its flexibility and minimal setup provide developers the freedom to organize projects according to their needs.</p>
<p>But sometimes, the best tools are those you're already familiar with. In my case, Eleventy was already on my radar from a previous project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why a wedding website?</h3>
<p>A dedicated wedding website brings several benefits to your wedding planning experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Centralized Information</h4>
<p>Your wedding website becomes the central hub for all essential information related to your big day.
Guests can effortlessly access details like the venue address, ceremony and reception times, dress code, and other relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Convenience for Guests</h4>
<p>Guests can access wedding details anytime, anywhere, reducing the likelihood of confusion or missed information. This is particularly helpful for out-of-town guests who may need travel and accommodation details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>RSVP Management</h4>
<p>Implementing an online RSVP feature streamlines guest responses and gathers important information such as dietary restrictions or song requests.
We found this feature especially useful when combined with Netlify. The ability to see RSVPs roll in and automate the process, including song requests, made the planning process more efficient. A simple Python script helped us build a Spotify playlist of our guests' songs to share with our DJ for inspiration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We discovered additional benefits such as interactive maps, photo/video sharing, and personalization. (Our website was designed to match the beautiful invitations from Allison Lee over at www.cowgoesmoo.com)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Hosting with Netlify</h3>
<p>Netlify has become one of my favorite hosting platforms, and for several good reasons. Firstly, it's 100% free to host up to 500 web apps, making it an ideal choice for startups, static websites, or small to midsize web apps. The free plan includes all the Netlify bells and whistles such as serverless functions, identity services (for logins and private sites), continuous deployment, free SSL certificates, edge functions, and much more.</p>
<p>One standout feature for my project was Netlify's exceptional handling of forms. Netlify simplifies form handling with its built-in form service, allowing form submissions to be processed without the need for server-side code. What's more, you can seamlessly receive form data via email or integrate it with third-party services. This functionality proved to be perfect for managing RSVPs – a crucial aspect of our project.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while the free plan covers a lot of ground, certain features may have limitations. For a startup, small business, or personal project, Netlify offers a robust and cost-effective solution with a user-friendly interface.</p>
